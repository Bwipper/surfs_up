# Temperatures in Hawaii for June and December

## Overview of Analysis
This project was created to review the temperatures in the months of June and December in Hawaii. They were going to be used to plan for a hypothetical opening of a surf and ice cream shop trip to the island.

Information was provided in a SQLite database. We used SQLite and SQLAlchemy and imported into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
